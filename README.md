# Workout Buddy

This is my first full-stack project/application. It is heavily based on this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98BzS5Oz5E4) by The Net Ninja.

## Technologies

### Front end 
* Developed with ReactJS
* [MUI](https://mui.com) for theming
* [Jotai](https://jotai.org/) for atom-based state management
* [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/) for data fetching

### Back end
* NodeJs & Express: backend application (written in TypeScript!)

### Databases
* MongoDB atlas for database
* Mongoose for enforced schemas

## Deployment
* Netlify for the front end
* Heroku for the back end
